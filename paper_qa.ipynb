In other words, copies of this tile may be assembled into tilings of the plane (the tile “admits\" tilings), yet copies of the tile cannot form periodic tilings, tilings that have translational symmetry.  In fact, the tile admits uncountably many tilings. In Sections\\xa0<ref>,\\xa0<ref>, and\\xa0<ref> we describe how these tilings all arise from substitution rules, showing that they all have the same local structure.\\n\\nGiven a set of two-dimensional tiles,  the nature of the planar tilings that they admit arises from a deep interaction between the local and the \\nglobal.  Constraints on the ways that pairs of tiles can \\nbe neighbours determine the structure of an infinite tiling, at all large scales. Constraints encoded in a set of tiles determine the structure of the space of the tilings that it admits, in subtle ways.\\n\\nAperiodic sets of tiles walk a fine line between order and disord', \"er, admitting tilings, but only  those without any translational symmetry, \\nnever permitting the simple repetition of  periodic tiling.  Their study dates to Wang's work\\xa0<cit.> on the then remaining open cases of Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem. Wang encoded logical fragments by what are now known as Wang tiles, congruent squares with coloured edges, to be\\ntiled by translation only with colours matching on adjoining edges.\\nHe conjectured that every set of Wang tiles that admits a tiling (possibly\\nusing only a subset of the tiles) must also\\nadmit a periodic tiling, and showed that this would imply the decidability\\nof the tiling problem (or domino problem): the question\\nof whether a given set of Wang tiles admits any tilings at all.\\nThe algorithm would consist of enumerating all possible ways to cover\\nlarger and larger disks.  Eventually one either will run out of ways to\\ncontinue, and the tiles do not admit a tiling; or, if there is a fundamental\\ndomain for a periodic tiling, one will ev\", \"entually discover it. \\nIf Wang's conjecture held and aperiodic sets of tiles did not exist, this\\nalgorithm would always terminate.\\n\\nBerger\\xa0<cit.> then showed that it was undecidable whether a set\\nof Wang tiles admits a tiling of the plane. He \\nconstructed the first aperiodic set of  20426\\xa0Wang tiles, which he used \\nas a kind of scaffolding for encoding finite but unbounded runs of arbitrary computation.\\n\\nSubsequent decades have spawned a rich literature on aperiodic tiling, touching many  different mathematical and scientific settings—we do not attempt a broad survey here. Yet there remain remarkably few really distinct methods of proving aperiodicity in the plane, despite or due to the underlying undecidability of the tiling problem. \\n\\nBerger's initial set comprised thousands of tiles, naturally prompting\\nthe question of how small a set of tiles could be while still forcing\\naperiodicity.   \\nProfessional and amateur mathematicians produced successively smaller aperiodic sets, culminati\", 'ng in discoveries by Penrose\\xa0<cit.>\\nand others of several consisting of just two tiles.  Surveys of these \\nsets appear in Chapters\\xa010 and\\xa011 of Grünbaum and Shephard\\xa0<cit.> and\\nin an account of the Trilobite and Cross tiles\\xa0<cit.>.\\nA recent table appears in the work of Greenfeld and Tao\\xa0<cit.>.\\n\\nThe obvious conclusion of this reduction in size would be to arrive at \\nan “einstein”,[A pun from the German “ein stein”, roughly “one \\nshape”, popularized by Danzer.] a single shape that tiles aperiodically. \\nIt has long been an open question whether such a tile exists.  Can one tile \\nembody enough complexity to forcibly disrupt  periodic order at all scales?\\n\\n §.§ The search for an einstein\\n\\nSeveral candidate tiles have been proposed as einsteins, but they all challenge in some way the concepts\\nof “tile”, “tiling”, or “aperiodic”.\\n\\nGummelt\\xa0<cit.> and Jeong and Steinhardt\\xa0<cit.>\\ndescribe a single regular decagon that can cover the plane with copies that are allowed to overlap by prescribed rul', \"es, but only non-periodically, in a manner tightly coupled to the Penrose tiling. \\nSenechal\\xa0<cit.> similarly describes simple rules that allow copies of the Penrose dart to overlap and cover the plane, but never periodically. The result is an ingenious route to aperiodicity, but not a \\ntiling in the usual sense.\\n\\nThe Taylor-Socolar tile\\xa0<cit.> comes within a hair's breadth\\nof being aperiodic.  Their hexagonal prototile tiles\\naperiodically, but only when additional matching conditions are enforced, \\npreventing certain adjacencies that would otherwise be permitted.\\nThese matching conditions mandate relationships\\nbetween non-adjacent tiles, making it impossible to encode \\nthe global aperiodicity in the shape of a two-dimensional topological\\ndisk.  The matching conditions can be expressed\\npurely geometrically, but doing so requires either a disconnected tile, a\\nthree-dimensional tile, or one with cutpoints\\xa0<cit.>. \\n\\nThe structure of the Taylor-Socolar\\ntiling is closely related to Penrose's\", ' 1+ϵ+ϵ^2\\ntiling\\xa0<cit.>. Like the Trilobite and Crab tiles\\xa0<cit.>, these can be adjusted so that an arbitrarily high fraction of the area lies in copies of just one kind of tile, but no matter how thin or small, the other tiles remain  necessary. \\n\\nThe Schmitt-Conway-Danzer tile\\xa0<cit.> tiles\\nℝ^3, with tilings that have a screw symmetry but not\\ntranslations as symmetries; no periodic tiling by copies of this tile has a compact fundamental domain, and we call this tile weakly  aperiodic. Weak aperiodicity  is indeed weak, and readily appears  in the hyperbolic plane and other non-amenable spaces—as early as 1974, Böröczky exhibited a weakly aperiodic monotile in the hyperbolic plane\\xa0<cit.>, the elegantly simple basis of the “binary tilings”\\xa0<cit.>.\\n\\nFollowing Mozes\\xa0<cit.>, we say a set of tiles is strongly aperiodic if it admits tilings but none with any infinite cyclic symmetry.  In the plane, for  sets of “normal” tiles,\\nthese concepts coincide\\xa0<cit.> and we do not need to make this dis', 'tinction.\\n\\nMatching rules for how tiles may fit together have taken many different forms in the literature, and, loosely speaking, it is often possible to shift the complexity in a construction from the tiles to the matching rules or vice versa. For example, if we use a finite atlas of finite configurations as our allowed matching rules, even the lowly 2×1 rectangle is an aperiodic monotile![Beginning with an aperiodic set of tiles with, say, geometric matching rules, pixelate pictures of the tiles and how they fit together, in some black and white bit-map. Take an atlas of these pictures, splitting black pixels vertically and white ones horizontally into identical rectangles. The rectangle is an aperiodic monotile with this atlas of matching rules.]\\nThe plainest possible rules are just that the tiles must fit together without gaps or overlapping interiors, and these remain the gold standard for an aperiodic monotile.\\n\\nMoving to higher dimensional space permits richer forms of aperiodi', 'city to\\narise.  Recently, Greenfeld and Tao\\xa0<cit.> showed that in sufficiently \\nhigh dimensions, a single tile, tiling only by translation, can be\\naperiodic in\\xa0ℤ^n (and thus in\\xa0ℝ^n).\\nThey also showed that it is undecidable whether a single\\ntile, again tiling by translation, admits a tiling of a periodic\\nsubset of ℤ^2 × G for some nonabelian group\\xa0G\\xa0<cit.>.\\nBy contrast, in\\xa0ℝ^2,\\nKenyon\\xa0<cit.>, building on the work of\\nGirault-Beauquier and Nivat\\xa0<cit.>, showed that\\nany topological disk that admits a tiling by translation also admits a\\nperiodic tiling, while Bhattacharya\\xa0<cit.> showed the\\nsame for any set in\\xa0ℤ^2.\\n\\nLittle is known about limits on what sorts of shapes could potentially be\\naperiodic monotiles.  Rao\\xa0<cit.> showed through a computer\\nsearch that the list of 15 known families of convex pentagons that tile the\\nplane is complete, thereby eliminating any remaining possibility\\nthat a convex polygon could be an einstein.\\nJeandel and Rao\\xa0<cit.> showed that the smallest aperiodic set\\nof', \" Wang tiles is of size\\xa011.\\n\\nEven when a single tile admits periodic tilings, that periodicity may be \\nmore or less abstruse, in a way that offers tantalizing hints about \\naperiodicity.  Here, the isohedral number of a tile is the minimum\\nnumber of transitivity classes in any tiling it admits; a tile is\\nanisohedral if its isohedral number is greater than one.\\nThe second part of Hilbert's 18th problem\\xa0<cit.> asked whether\\nthere exist anisohedral polyhedra in ℝ^3. Grünbaum and \\nShephard suggest\\n<cit.> that this question was asked in ℝ^3\\nbecause Hilbert assumed that no such tiles exist in the plane, yet\\nReinhardt\\xa0<cit.> found an example of such a polyhedron, and\\nHeesch\\xa0<cit.> then gave an example of such a tile in the plane.\\nMany anisohedral prototiles are known today. The computer enumeration\\nby Myers\\xa0<cit.> furnished numerous anisohedral polyominoes, \\npolyhexes, and polyiamonds, including a record-holding 16-hex that\\ntiles with a minimum of ten transitivity classes.  It is unknown whethe\", \"r\\nthere is an upper bound on isohedral numbers of monotiles.[The problem of  determining whether or not a given set of tiles admits a periodic tiling is also undecidable, at least for larger sets of tiles\\xa0<cit.>. If we enumerate sets of tiles, and define I(n) to be the isohedral number of the nth set, if it admits a periodic tiling, and let I(n) = -1 otherwise, then I(n) cannot be bounded by any computable function. This defies our imagination.]\\n\\nRelated insights can be gleaned from the study of shapes that do not tile\\nthe plane.  A shape's Heesch number is the largest possible \\ncombinatorial radius of any patch formed by copies of the shape (or\\nequivalently, the maximum number of complete concentric rings that can \\nbe constructed around it).  A shape that tiles the plane is said to have a\\nHeesch number of ∞.  Heesch first exhibited a shape with Heesch\\nnumber\\xa01, and a few isolated examples with Heesch numbers up to three were\\ndiscovered thereafter\\xa0<cit.>.  Mann and Thomas discovered ma\", \"rked\\npolyforms with Heesch numbers up to\\xa05 through a brute-force computer \\nsearch\\xa0<cit.>.

It is a polykite:\\nthe union of eight kites in the Laves tiling [3.4.6.4], the dual to the \\n(3.4.6.4) Archimedean tiling.\\n\\nWe provide two different proofs of aperiodicity, both with novel\\naspects.  The first proof follows the structure shown in\\nfig:proofs', \"tructure, centred on a \\nnew approach in sec:coupling for proving aperiodicity in the plane.\\nWe observe that\\nany tiling by the hat corresponds to tilings by two different\\npolyiamonds, one with twice the area of the other.  If there were a\\nstrongly periodic tiling by the hat, the other two tilings would also\\nbe strongly periodic. We prove that if so, the lattices of\\ntranslations in the polyiamond tilings would necessarily be related by a\\nsimilarity; but\\nno similarity between lattices of translations on the regular\\ntriangular tiling can have the scale factor\\xa0√(2) required by the\\nratio of the areas.  This does not show that a tiling exists, and so\\nmust be combined with an explicit construction of a tiling (outlined\\nin sec:discussion and given in detail in Sections\\n<ref> and\\xa0<ref>) to complete the proof of\\naperiodicity.\\n\\nThe second proof presented (but the first one found) follows the structure\\nshown in fig:proofstructure2.  Here we generally adhere to\\nBerger's approach, but we must begin w\", 'ith a novel step\\nto get to the point where such a proof is possible.  \\nWe first show that in any tiling by\\nthe hat polykite, every tile belongs uniquely to one of four distinct\\nclusters (sec:clusters), and that those clusters fit together\\nfollowing certain matching rules.\\nIt is then the clusters that allow a more standard style of \\nhierarchical construction.\\nThis  remarkable behaviour has not been seen previously in the literature.\\n\\nDefining matching rules on the boundaries of the clusters allows us to\\ndiscard details of how the clusters are made up of hats, and instead\\nconsider simplified outlines we refer to as metatiles.\\nFollowing Berger et al., we then give an inductive proof in sec:subst\\nshowing that any\\ntile in any tiling by these four metatiles lies in a unique hierarchy\\nof larger and larger supertiles, effectively combinatorial copies\\nof the metatiles, at larger and larger scales. The proof is\\nconstructive: we first show the metatiles can only lie within larger\\nclusters, the 1-', 'level supertiles, uniquely, and that these clusters\\nhave the same combinatorial structure as the metatiles. In turn, in\\nthe same manner, the 1-level supertiles can only lie uniquely within\\n2-level supertiles, again clusters with the same combinatorics, and so on\\nfor subsequent levels.\\nThis construction proves that tilings by copies of the\\nmetatiles can only be non-periodic, because if there were a\\ntranslational symmetry, these hierarchies of supertiles could not be\\nunique. It also shows that the metatiles (and hence the hats) admit \\ntilings of the plane, because we\\nconstruct clusters of arbitrary size\\xa0<cit.>.\\n\\nBecause of the combinatorial complexity of the hat polykite, \\na significant fraction of our second proof relies on exhaustive enumeration\\nof cases, which we carried out and cross-checked with two \\nindependent software implementations developed by two of the authors\\nin isolation.  These calculations are necessarily ad hoc, and are essentially\\nunenlightening.  This case\\nanalysis is', ' only needed to show that all tilings follow the\\nsubstitution structure; it is not needed for showing that a tiling\\nexists, and thus is not needed to show that the tile is aperiodic,\\ngiven the proof in sec:coupling that no periodic tiling exists.\\n\\nWe close this introduction with definitions of the essential terminology\\nwe will need for the rest of the article.\\nIn sec:discussion,\\nwe then present a compendium of provisional observations about this polykite,\\nincluding an explicit construction of a tiling and aspects of its structure\\nthat deserve further study.  Our two proofs of aperiodicity follow:\\nwe show that there are no periodic tilings (sec:coupling),\\nthen that tiles must group into clusters that define metatiles\\nequipped with matching rules (sec:clusters),\\nand finally that metatiles must compose into\\nsupertiles with combinatorially equivalent matching rules\\n(sec:subst).\\nIn sec:family, we offer additional remarks about the continuum\\nof tiles that contains the hat polykite.  As noted', ' there,\\ncomputer search shows that the hat is the smallest aperiodic polykite.\\n\\n §.§ Terminology\\n\\nTerminology used for tilings generally follows that of\\nGrünbaum and Shephard\\xa0<cit.>.\\n\\nA tile in a metric space is a closed set of points from that\\nspace. A tiling by a set of tiles is a collection of images of\\ntiles from that set under isometries, the interiors of which are\\npairwise disjoint and the union of which is the whole space; we\\nsay a set of tiles admits the tiling, or in the case of a single tile\\nthat it admits the tiling.  For most purposes, it is convenient for\\ntiles to be nonempty compact sets that are the closures of their\\ninteriors; the tiles considered here are polygons, or more generally\\nclosed topological disks.  A\\ntiling is monohedral if all its tiles are congruent.  All\\ntilings considered here are also locally finite: every point\\nhas some open neighbourhood that meets only finitely many tiles (all\\nmonohedral plane tilings by closed topological disks are locally\\nfinite).\\n', '\\nIn any locally finite tiling of the plane by closed topological disks,\\nthe connected components of the intersection of two or more tiles are\\nisolated points, which are called vertices of the tiling, and\\nJordan arcs, which are called edges of the tiling, and the\\nboundary of any tile is divided into finitely many edges, alternating\\nwith vertices. Each edge lies on the boundary of exactly two tiles,\\nwhich we refer to as lying on opposite sides of the edge.  Two\\ndistinct tiles are neighbours if they share any point of their\\nboundaries, and adjacents if they share an edge.\\n\\nWhen a (closed topological disk) tile has a polygonal boundary, we\\nrefer to it as having sides (maximal straight line segments\\nlying on that boundary) and corners (between two sides), to\\ndistinguish from the edges and vertices of a tiling.  We rely on\\ncontext to distinguish the meanings of “side” as referring to sides\\nof a polygon or the two sides of an edge of a tiling.  A tiling by\\npolygons is edge-to-edge if the corn', 'ers and sides of the\\npolygons coincide with the vertices and edges of the tiling.\\n\\nA patch of tiles is a collection of non-overlapping tiles whose\\nunion is a topological disk.  More specifically, a 0-patch\\nis a patch containing a single tile, and an (n+1)-patch is \\na patch formed from the union of an n-patch P and a set S of\\nadditional tiles, so that P lies in the interior of the patch and no\\nproper subset of\\xa0S yields a patch with P in its interior.  (In\\nother words, an (n+1)-patch is\\na tile surrounded by n concentric rings of tiles.)  In a fixed tiling,\\nevery tile generates an n-patch for all finite n, by recursively\\nconstructing an (n-1)-patch and adjoining all its neighbours in the\\ntiling, along with any other tiles required to fill in holes left by\\nadding neighbours.\\n\\nGiven a tiling\\xa0𝒯, a poly-𝒯-tile is a\\nclosed topological disk that is the union of finitely many tiles\\nfrom\\xa0𝒯. Poly-𝒯-tiles are also referred to\\ngenerically as polyforms.  Poly-𝒯-tiles may also\\nbe defined so that they ', 'are permitted to have holes.\\nBecause we are mainly concerned with tiles\\nthat admit monohedral tilings, it is not generally significant for the\\npurposes of this paper whether shapes with holes are allowed or not.\\n\\nThe symmetry group of a tiling is the group of those isometries\\nthat act as a permutation on the tiles of the tiling.  A tiling is\\nweakly periodic if its symmetry group has an element of\\ninfinite order; in the plane, this means it includes a nonzero\\ntranslation.  A tiling is strongly periodic if the symmetry\\ngroup has a discrete subgroup with cocompact action on the space\\ntiled. In Euclidean space, all strongly periodic\\ntilings are also weakly periodic.  A set of tiles (or a single tile)\\nis weakly aperiodic if it admits a tiling but does not admit a\\nstrongly periodic tiling, and strongly aperiodic if it admits a\\ntiling but does not admit a weakly periodic tiling.\\n\\nAny finite set of polygons in the plane that admits a weakly periodic\\nedge-to-edge tiling also admits a strongly p', 'eriodic\\ntiling\\xa0<cit.>, and a similar but simpler argument\\nshows the same to be the case for a finite set of\\npoly-𝒯-tiles where 𝒯 is itself a strongly\\nperiodic tiling and the weakly periodic tiling consists of copies \\nof the\\ntiles all aligned to the same underlying copy of\\xa0𝒯,\\ninstead of being edge-to-edge.  Thus in such contexts it is not\\nnecessary to distinguish weak and strong aperiodicity and we refer to\\ntiles and sets of tiles simply as aperiodic.\\n\\nA uniform tiling\\xa0<cit.> is an edge-to-edge\\ntiling by regular polygons with vertex-transitive symmetry group;\\nnotation such as (3.4.6.4), listing the sequence of regular polygons\\nround each vertex, denotes a uniform tiling.  A Laves\\ntiling\\xa0<cit.> is an edge-to-edge monohedral tiling by\\nconvex polygons with regular vertices (all angles between consecutive\\nedges at a vertex equal) and tile-transitive symmetry group; analogous\\nnotation such as [3.4.6.4] is used for Laves tilings, listing the\\nsequence of vertex degrees round each tile, and in ', 'an appropriate\\nsense Laves tilings are dual to uniform tilings.\\n', \"\\\\section{The hat polykite and its tilings}\\n\\\\label{sec:discussion}\\n\\n\\\\label{sec:substitution} %% If the proof that the tiles admit a subst tiling moves to another section, move this here. \\n\\nBefore proceeding to the full proof of aperiodicity, we \\nfirst offer a less formal presentation of the hat, including an explicit\\nconstruction of a tiling.  This section \\nfulfills three goals.  First, it offers an abundance of visual \\nintuition, which provides context for the technical machinery that will\\nfollow.  Second, it gives some sense of our process of discovery and\\nanalysis, though it should not be interpreted as an ordered timeline.\\nThird, it includes a few observations that will not be \\nconsidered further in this article, but which might provide opportunities\\nfor future work by others.\\n\\nOne of the authors (Smith) began investigating the hat polykite as\\npart of his open-ended visual exploration of shapes and their tiling\\nproperties.  Working largely by hand, with the assistance of\\nScherphuis'\", \"s PolyForm Puzzle Solver \\nsoftware (\\\\href{https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/polysolver.htm}{\\\\nolinkurl{www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/polysolver.htm}}),\\nhe could find no obvious barriers to the construction of large patches, \\nand yet no clear cluster of tiles that filled the plane periodically.\\n\\nBecause the hat is a polyform, it was natural at this point to\\nobtain an initial diagnosis of its tiling properties computationally.\\nWe modified Kaplan's SAT-based Heesch number software~\\\\cite{Kaplan}\\nto determine that if the hat does not tile the plane, then its\\nHeesch number must be at least 16.  Similarly, we modified Myers'\\npolyform tiling software~\\\\cite{Myers} to determine that if the hat\\nadmits periodic tilings, then its isohedral number must be at least\\n64.  These two computations already establish that the hat is of\\nextreme interest---if it had turned out not to be an einstein, then \\nit would have shattered either\\nthe record for Heesch numbers or the record for isohedral numbers,\\nin both cases b\", \"y a wide margin!  \\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[htp!]\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n\\\\includegraphics[width=\\\\textwidth]{patch_alt.pdf}\\n\\\\end{center}\\n\\\\caption{\\\\label{fig:patch10}A computer-generated $10$-patch of 392 hats\\n\\t(left), arranged in ten concentric rings around a central shaded hat.\\n\\tThe tiles can be coloured (right), showing that the reflected \\n\\thats (dark blue) are sparsely distributed and each is surrounded by\\n\\ta congruent ``shell'' of three unreflected hats (light blue).\\n\\tA thickened outline shows the boundary of the maximal cluster\\n\\tof tiles that appears congruently around every reflected tile.}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\n\\\\fig{fig:patch10} (left) shows a computer-generated $10$-patch \\n(i.e., ten concentric rings of tiles around a shaded central tile,\\nwhere each tile in a ring touches the ring it encloses in at least one \\npoint).

A single hat is asymmetric, \\nand so in any patch we can distinguish between ``unreflected'' and \\n``reflected'' orientations of tiles.  In the patches we computed,\\nreflected tiles, shown in dark blue, are always\\ndistributed sparsely and evenly within a field of unreflected tiles.\\nFurthermore, every reflected tile is contained within a congruent cluster\\nof nine tiles, where the other eight tiles in the cluster are unreflected.\\nOne such cluster is outlined in bold in the illustration.

Every reflected tile\\nresides in a congruent, non-overlapping copy of this shell.\\n\\nWe have also observed that unreflected tiles tend to form long\\n``chains'' of like orientation, occasionally interrupted by reflecte\", 'd\\ntiles.  The chains contained in the example patch are shown coloured\\non the left in \\\\fig{fig:patch10col}.  Because the hats are aligned\\nwith the underlying kite grid, unreflected tiles come in six\\norientations, all of which also appear as chain directions.  Chains\\nmay end at reflected tiles or pass through them, but each reflected\\ntile is a hub for at least two, and at most five spokes.  \\nLong segments of these chains have boundaries with halfturn symmetry.\\nIt is tempting to seek parallels between these chains and linear\\nfeatures in other aperiodic tilings, such as Ammann bars~\\\\cite[Section\\n10.6]{GS} and Conway worms~\\\\cite[Section 10.5]{GS}.\\nFinally, we have noticed that these chains seem to impart a rough\\nhexagonal arrangement to the hats, which is particularly clear in the\\ntriangular and parallelogram-shaped structures that are surrounded\\nby chains.  We have found that if we merge each reflected tile with its\\nimmediate neighbour as shown in \\\\fig{fig:patch10col} (centre), then the\\nt', 'iles in any patch can be put into one-to-one correspondence with a \\npatch of hexagons, as in \\\\fig{fig:patch10col} (right).

However, with\\nthe obvious exception of the $T$, none of the \\nsupertiles is truly similar to its corresponding metatile.\\nDespite that discrepancy, the supertiles are fully\\ncompatible with the construction in \\\\fig{fig:supertiles}---they\\ncan be arranged in the same configuration shown on the left, and used as\\na scaffolding for deriving outlines of super-supertiles (implicitly\\nyielding a much larger patch of hats along the way).  Indeed, the construction\\ncan be iterated any number of times, with slightly different outlines in\\nevery generation.  We are not aware', \" of other substitution systems that\\nuse rules like these, where successive generations are combinatorially\\nbut not geometrically compatible.\\nTo see this construction in action, please try our interactive\\nbrowser-based visualization tool at\\n\\\\href{https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/hat/}{\\\\nolinkurl{cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/hat/}}.\\n\\nWe know from \\\\fig{fig:simp_outlines} that each of the four metatiles\\ncan be associated with a cluster of hats.  The construction in\\n\\\\fig{fig:supertiles} can then be iterated any number of times to form\\never-larger patches of metatiles, and hence of hats.  We can, for \\nexample, consider the $H$ supertiles formed through this process of\\niteration, and the patch of hats each one contains.  These patches form\\na sequence that grows in radius without bound, each patch a subset of\\nits successor.  The Extension Theorem~\\\\cite[Section 3.8]{GS} allows\\nus to continue this iteration process ``to infinity'', yielding the\\nfollowing result.\\n\\n\\\\begin{theorem}\\n\\\\label{thm:subst_tiling}\\n\\tTh\", 'e hat polykite admits tilings of the plane.\\n\\\\end{theorem}\\n\\nOf course, this theorem is not sufficient to establish aperiodicity\\non its own---we must also show that the hat does not also admit\\nperiodic tilings.  In \\\\secref{sec:subst} we revisit this\\nsubstitution process, tracking matching conditions on supertile edges\\nafter every step.  There we show that \\\\textit{all} tilings by the \\nhat necessarily obey the substitution rules given here\\n(Theorem~\\\\ref{thm:subst}).  The construction in that section also\\nincidentally leads to a more detailed proof that the hat tiles the plane.\\n\\nThe shapes of each generation of supertiles are different from those\\nof the generation before it.  However, by normalizing the tiles for\\nsize, we have computed that they quickly converge on a fixed point, a \\nset of tiles that truly do yield scaled copies of themselves under the\\nconstruction in \\\\fig{fig:supertiles}.  These converged tile\\nshapes are particularly interesting because they can be used to define a \\ngeomet', 'ric substitution system that operates via inflation and replacement.\\nThe converged tiles, together with\\ntheir substitution rules, are shown in \\\\fig{fig:perfect}.\\nBy virtue of its connection to the original metatiles in\\n\\\\fig{fig:simp_outlines}, we know that this substitution tiling is aperiodic\\nwhen the tiles are endowed with suitable matching conditions on their\\nedges.  We can also use this system as an alternative means of constructing \\npatches of hats.  We cannot simply associate a cluster of hats rigidly with\\neach converged tile, but a patch of converged tiles is combinatorially\\nequivalent to a corresponding patch of metatiles, which are\\nequipped with hats.\\n\\nIf we rescale the converged tiles so that the short $H$ edges\\nhave unit length, then all tile edges except the two $F$ edges adjacent to\\na fylfot centre will have lengths in $\\\\mathbb{Z}[\\\\phi]$, where $\\\\phi$ is the\\ngolden ratio.

In the next section\\nwe present a novel geometric proof of aperiodicity.  Then, in \\nSections~\\\\ref{sec:clusters} and~\\\\ref{sec:subst} we turn to a more standard\\ncombinatorial argument that the matching rules implied by ', 'the \\nsubstitution system shown earlier are forced in tilings by the hat.\\n\\n\\\\FloatBarrier\\n', '\\n\\n§ APERIODICITY VIA COUPLING OF POLYIAMOND TILINGS\\n\\nIn this section, we prove the following result:\\n\\nLet 𝒯 be a tiling by the hat polykite.  Then 𝒯\\nis not strongly periodic.\\n\\nAs noted in sec:terminology, a tile that does not admit strongly\\nperiodic tilings also cannot admit weakly periodic tilings.  Therefore,\\ntogether with the substitution system outlined in\\nsec:discussion, and described in detail in\\nSections\\xa0<ref> and\\xa0<ref>, this theorem establishes\\nthat the hat is an\\naperiodic monotile, thus proving Theorem\\xa0<ref>.  The latter\\ntwo sections provide a detailed case\\nanalysis showing that all tilings by the\\nhat polykite are given by the substitution system, and as a\\nconsequence giving an alternative proof that it is an aperiodic\\nmonotile.  Deducing aperiodicity from the result of this section does\\nnot rely on that case analysis, only on the existence of\\ntilings. We require only the description of the substitution system\\nand the clusters of tiles used in that system, not the proof that a', 'll\\ntilings necessarily obey that system.\\n\\nWe suppose throughout this section that there is a strongly periodic\\ntiling\\xa0𝒯 by the hat polykite, and derive a contradiction.\\nWe also suppose this tiling is aligned to an underlying [3.4.6.4]\\nLaves tiling; this supposition is justified by Lemma\\xa0<ref>,\\nwhich shows that all tilings by the hat polykite are aligned to such an\\nunderlying Laves tiling.\\n\\n    < g r a p h i c s >\\n\\nA patch from a hat tiling 𝒯 (left),\\n\\twhich in this section, for eventual contradiction,  is hypothesized to be strongly periodic.  By \\n\\tcontracting edges we can construct patches from corresponding \\n\\t𝒯_4 (centre) and 𝒯_8 (right) tilings.  Equivalent\\n\\treference tiles are marked with asterisks in the three patches.\\n\\nContracting the polykite sides of length 1 or\\xa02 to length\\xa00\\nproduces a strongly periodic tiling\\xa0𝒯_4 by tetriamonds;\\ncontracting the polykite sides of length\\xa0√(3) to length\\xa00\\nproduces a strongly periodic tiling\\xa0𝒯_8 by octiamonds.\\n(Because this contraction process is ', 'well-defined around any tile,\\nedge or vertex, it yields a combinatorial tiling of the plane, and a\\ncombinatorial tiling corresponds to a geometrical tiling of the entire\\nplane\\xa0<cit.>.)  We\\nsuppose that 𝒯_4 and 𝒯_8 use the same side\\nlengths as the corresponding sides of the polykite, and have\\ncorresponding tiles in the same orientation.  \\nfig:tt4t8 shows a patch from an example tiling 𝒯, together\\nwith corresponding patches from 𝒯_4 and 𝒯_8.\\nThis mapping to tiles of\\ndifferent side lengths is discussed in more detail in\\nsec:family, where the tetriamond is described as\\nTile(0,√(3)) and the octiamond is described as\\nTile(1,0).\\n\\nThe tilings 𝒯, 𝒯_4, and 𝒯_8 \\nare coupled, in the sense that there is a bijection\\nbetween their tiles, with corresponding tiles in corresponding\\norientations and translation symmetries of any one mapping directly to\\ntranslation symmetries of the others.  They also have close combinatorial\\nrelationships: any neighbours in the original\\npolykite tiling are also neighbour', 's in both polyiamond tilings.  Furthermore,\\nthere must exist affine maps between the lattices of translations of the\\n𝒯_4 and 𝒯_8 tilings, such that\\neach translation maps to\\na corresponding translation (one between corresponding pairs of\\ntiles).  The affine map sending the translations for\\xa0𝒯_4\\nto those for\\xa0𝒯_8 must scale areas by 2/3.\\n\\nThat affine map cannot be a similarity.  Any distance\\xa0d between\\nvertices of a regular triangular tiling with edge length\\xa01 must have\\nd^2 of the form x^2+xy+y^2 for integers x and\\xa0y, and if 2^k\\n∥ x^2+xy+y^2 then k\\xa0must be even.  Therefore, a scale factor\\nof\\xa0√(2) is not possible between translations on two triangular\\ntilings with the same edge length, and a scale factor of\\xa0√(2/3)\\nis not possible between translations on two triangular tilings with\\nedge lengths √(3) and\\xa01.\\n\\nUsing the fact that the six translation classes of kites must appear\\nwith equal frequency in any aligned tiling by polykites, we now\\nproceed to show that the affine map from 𝒯_4 to \\n𝒯_8 mu', 'st in fact be a similarity, which\\ngives the required contradiction.\\n\\nIn Figure\\xa0<ref>, we show the hat polykite, with sides\\nof length 1 or\\xa02 shown as thin black\\nline segments and sides of length\\xa0√(3) shown as thick\\norange line segments; the two\\norientations of kite of which it has two kites (it has exactly one\\nkite of each other orientation); and the two polyiamonds, in\\norientations corresponding to those of the polykite.\\n\\n[x=5mm,y=5mm]\\n  [] -1-1 – 00 – 4-2;\\n  [] 00 – 1-2 – 2-2 –\\n    20;\\n  [] 2-2 – 3-3 – 2-4;\\n  [] -21 – -20 – 0-2 –\\n    1-2;\\n  [] 4-5 – 4-4 – 3-3;\\n  [] 30 – 20 – 11;\\n  [,ultra thick] 11– 00 –\\n    -21;\\n  [,ultra thick] 1-2 – 2-4 –\\n    4-5;\\n  [,ultra thick] 3-3 – 4-2 –\\n    30;\\n  [] 6-3 – 10-5 – 10-4 –\\n    9-3 – 7-5 – 6-4 – cycle;\\n  [,ultra thick] 12-6 – 14-7 –\\n    15-6 – 16-8 – 15-9 –\\n    13-8 – cycle;\\n  [] 18-9 – 20-11 –\\n    21-11 – 21-10 – 20-9 –\\n    19-9 – 18-8 – cycle;\\n\\nThe hat polykite, its imbalance in kites, and corresponding polyiamonds\\n\\nThe imbalance in kites of dif', 'ferent orientations partitions the twelve\\norientations of the hat polykite (that can occur while aligned to an\\nunderlying [3.4.6.4] Laves tiling) into three sets of four, such\\nthat any tiling must have equal proportions of polykites from each set\\nof orientations (meaning that in any patch with perimeter\\xa0x, the\\nimbalance between the numbers of polykites with orientations from any\\ntwo of the sets is\\xa0O(x)).  The same applies to tilings by either\\npolyiamond derived from tilings by the polykite.  (The tetriamond is\\nsymmetric, so two orientations of the polykite in one of those sets\\ncan give rise to identical-looking tetriamonds.  Those should still be\\nconsidered as different orientations of the tetriamond, as if it were\\ngiven an asymmetric marking.)\\n\\nNote that given any two sides of polyiamonds in\\xa0𝒯_4, the\\ncorresponding vector in\\xa0𝒯_8 between those two sides is\\nwell-defined: a side of a tile in\\xa0𝒯_4 corresponds to a\\npoint on the boundary of the corresponding tile in\\xa0𝒯_8\\n(and adjoining sides o', \"n adjacent tiles correspond to the same point on\\nthe boundaries of two neighbouring tiles in\\xa0𝒯_8), so the\\nvector is just the vector between those corresponding points.  It is\\nalso convenient for some purposes to divide the tetriamond into two\\ncongruent rhombi, resulting in a tiling\\xa0𝒯_4'.  The four\\norientations of the tetriamond in one of the three sets of\\norientations all contain rhombi in the same two orientations (out of a\\npossible three), so 𝒯_4'\\xa0contains equal proportions of\\nrhombi in each orientation.\\n\\n    < g r a p h i c s >\\n\\nA visualization of the three families of\\n\\ti-strips in each of 𝒯_4' and 𝒯_4, for the \\n\\tsample patch shown in fig:tt4t8 (centre).

For each\\ni∈{1,2,3}, we now form an infinite graph\\xa0𝒢_i. \\nThe vertices\", \" of\\xa0𝒢_i are \\nthose rhombi of\\xa0𝒯_4' that include an edge\\nlying in some line in\\xa0ℒ_i, thereby encompassing rhombi\\nin two of the three orientations.\\nTwo vertices in 𝒢_i are connected by an edge exactly\\nwhen the rhombi corresponding to those vertices are adjacent along an \\nedge of\\xa0𝒯_4' lying on some line in\\xa0ℒ_i.\\nThe connected\\ncomponents of this graph are two-way infinite paths, which we refer to\\nas i-strips in\\xa0𝒯_4'.  \\nWe then partition the tiles of 𝒯_4 into a related set of \\ni-strips by assigning each polyiamond to the same strip as one of its\\nrhombi.  If a\\npolyiamond has both rhombi in an orientation that appears in\\ni-strips, they must be in the same i-strip, because the line\\nsegment between those two rhombi lies in a line in\\xa0ℒ_i.\\nNote that this assignment must constitute a partition of the tiles\\nin 𝒯_4.\\nClearly, the i-strips cannot cross, and any line\\nparallel to those in\\xa0ℒ_i passes through the i-strips\\nin\\xa0𝒯_4' in the same order as any other such line passes\\nthrough them.  Furthermore, any\", \" translation preserves both i-strips\\nthemselves and that ordering of i-strips.  fig:istrips shows\\nexamples of the three families of i-strips for sample patches of\\n𝒯_4' and 𝒯_4.\\n\\nLet 𝐯_i be a vector between two consecutive lines\\nin\\xa0ℒ_i, orthogonal to those lines, chosen so the pairwise\\nangles between those vectors are all\\xa0120^∘.  Let 𝐯'_i\\nbe a vector orthogonal to\\xa0𝐯_i and with length 1/√(3)\\ntimes that of\\xa0𝐯_i, again chosen so the pairwise angles\\nbetween those vectors are all\\xa0120^∘.  Note that ∑_i\\n𝐯_i = 0 and ∑_i 𝐯'_i = 0.  Considering the\\nsides of rhombi in an i-strip in\\xa0𝒯_4' that lie in\\nconsecutive lines of\\xa0ℒ_i, the vector between the midpoints\\nof such sides is 𝐯_i ±𝐯'_i, where the sign\\ndepends on the orientation of the rhombus.  Thus, if the vector\\nbetween any two such midpoints is a 𝐯_i + b 𝐯'_i,\\nthen between those two sides there are (a+b)/2 rhombi of one\\norientation and (a-b)/2 of the other orientation that can appear in\\nan i-strip in\\xa0𝒯_4'.\\n\\nConsidering as symmetries of\\xa0𝒯_4' only th\", \"ose translations\\nthat correspond to translation symmetries of the strongly periodic\\ntiling\\xa0𝒯, there are only finitely many orbits of rhombi\\nunder the action of the group of such translations, so in any\\ni-strip\\xa0𝒮 there must be two rhombi in the same orbit.\\nThe translation mapping one to the other is a translation symmetry of\\nthe tiling, and therefore maps i-strips to i-strips. Because it maps\\n𝒮 to itself and preserves the ordering of i-strips, it\\nmust map every i-strip to itself.  If that translation is by a\\nvector a 𝐯_i + b 𝐯'_i, it follows that b=0,\\nbecause otherwise rhombi of the two orientations that appear in\\ni-strips would appear in the tiling in different proportions.\\n\\nThus for each i we have some positive integer\\xa0a_i, such that a\\ntranslation by a_i 𝐯_i is a symmetry of\\xa0𝒯_4'\\nand of 𝒯_4 (corresponding to a translation symmetry\\nof\\xa0𝒯, and thus to one of\\xa0𝒯_8) that sends each\\ni-strip to itself.  We may replace each\\xa0a_i by their lowest common\\nmultiple, so we have a positive integer\\xa0a s\", \"uch that for each\\xa0i a\\ntranslation by a 𝐯_i is a symmetry that sends each\\ni-strip to itself.\\n\\nWe now examine the translation vectors in\\xa0𝒯_8\\ncorresponding to a 𝐯_i in\\xa0𝒯_4\\nor\\xa0𝒯_4'.  These may be calculated based on the tiles in\\nany i-strip in\\xa0𝒯_4 (between any two lines\\nin\\xa0ℒ_i related by a translation by that vector), and every\\ni-strip (and choice of lines) must produce the same vector\\nin\\xa0𝒯_8.

In\\nthis section, we give a precise definition of how tiles are assigned\\nto clusters, and a computer-assisted proof by case analysis that\\nthis assignment does result in the clusters claimed, fitting together\\nin accordance with the matching rules given.  \\n\\nmargin=0pt\\n\\n[Cluster T]\\n  [x=5mm,y=5mm]\\n  [,ultra thick] 2-2 – 8-2 –\\n    24 – cycle;\\n  6000T_1;\\n  23 – 24;\\n  7-1 – 8-2;\\n  2-2;\\n  8-2;\\n  24;\\n  02B^+;\\n  5-3A^-;\\n  52A^-;\\n\\n     [Cluster H]\\n[x=5mm,y=5mm]\\n  [,ultra thick] 20 – 4-2 –\\n    12-2 – 120 – 48 –\\n    28 – cycle;\\n  24002H_1;', '\\n  60-12H_2;\\n  6011H_3;\\n  30001H_4;\\n  20;\\n  4-2;\\n  10-2;\\n  12-2;\\n  120;\\n  66;\\n  48;\\n  28;\\n  22;\\n  3-2.5X^+;\\n  8-3B^-;\\n  11.5-3X^-;\\n  14-2X^+;\\n  94B^-;\\n  5.57.5X^-;\\n  39.5X^+;\\n  05.5A^+;\\n  11.5X^-;\\n\\n \\n [Cluster P]\\n[x=5mm,y=5mm]\\n  [,ultra thick] 00 – 4-4 –\\n    12-4 – 80 – cycle;\\n  000P_1;\\n  6010P_2;\\n  11-3 – 12-4;\\n  00;\\n  2-2;\\n  4-4;\\n  6-4;\\n  12-4;\\n  10-2;\\n  80;\\n  60;\\n  0.5-1.5L;\\n  2.5-3.5X^-;\\n  5-5X^+;\\n  9-5A^-;\\n  11.5-2.5L;\\n  9.5-0.5X^-;\\n  71X^+;\\n  31.5B^+;\\n\\n     [Cluster F]\\n[x=5mm,y=5mm]\\n  [,ultra thick] 00 – 4-4 –\\n    10-4 – 10-2 – 80 – cycle;\\n  000F_1;\\n  6010F_2;\\n  00;\\n  2-2;\\n  4-4;\\n  6-4;\\n  8-4;\\n  10-4;\\n  10-2;\\n  80;\\n  60;\\n  0.5-1.5L;\\n  2.5-3.5X^-;\\n  5-5X^+;\\n  7.5-5L;\\n  9.5-5X^-;\\n  11.5-3.5F^+;\\n  9.5-0.5F^-;\\n  71X^+;\\n  31.5B^+;\\n\\nThe four clusters\\n\\nThe clusters and their associated metatiles\\nare shown in Figure\\xa0<ref>.\\nEach metatile is a convex polyiamond outlined in\\nlime; its hats are overlaid, and \\neach is given a unique label.\\nThe union of the polykites in a cluster approximates t', 'he shape of\\nits metatile, but with some indentations and protrusions along its\\nboundary.  At two corners of cluster\\xa0T, and one of cluster\\xa0P, an\\nadditional line is drawn from a corner of a polykite to a corner of\\nthe boundary of the polyiamond; this shows how an indentation to a\\ncorner of the polyiamond is considered to be associated with a\\nparticular side of the polyiamond.  \\n\\nThe boundaries of the four metatiles\\nare divided into labeled segments by marked points.\\nThe labels represent matching conditions to be obeyed in tilings \\nby the metatiles.  To satisfy the matching conditions, the four\\nmetatiles must form a tiling using copies that are only rotated and\\nnot reflected; edge segments marked A^+ and\\xa0A^- must adjoin on\\nadjacent tiles of the tiling; likewise, edge segments B^+ and\\xa0B^-,\\nX^+ and\\xa0X^-, F^+ and\\xa0F^-, and L and\\xa0L must adjoin.\\nWe will show in sec:subst that any\\ntiling by the metatiles has a substitution structure: the tiles may be\\ngrouped (after bisecting some tiles) into supe', 'rtiles that satisfy\\ncombinatorially equivalent matching conditions.  From this structure, it is\\ndeduced that no tiling by the metatiles is periodic; also, the\\nsubstitution structure implies that the metatiles can tile arbitrarily\\nlarge regions of the plane, and so the whole plane, implying that they form an\\naperiodic set.\\n\\nWe now show the following result:\\n\\nAny tiling by the hat polykite can be divided into the clusters shown\\nin Figure\\xa0<ref> (or reflections thereof, but not\\nmixing reflected and non-reflected clusters), satisfying the given\\nmatching conditions, with the resulting tiling by metatiles having the\\nsame symmetries as the original tiling by polykites.\\n\\nSince inspection\\nof the cluster shapes shows that, conversely, any tiling by metatiles\\ninduces one by the hat polykite (for example, A^+ and A^- are\\nequal and opposite modifications to the shape of an edge and are\\nconsistent wherever they appear in the clusters), that suffices to\\nshow that the hat polykite is an aperiodic monot', 'ile.\\n\\nThis proof that any tiling can be divided into clusters, satisfying\\nthe matching conditions, is computer-assisted.  We define rules\\n(sec:clusters:rules) for\\nassigning labels to tiles in any tiling by the hat polykite, corresponding\\nto the labels shown for the tiles in the four clusters.  Those rules\\nassign a label to a tile based only on its immediate neighbours, and\\nbecause no arbitrary choices are involved in the rules, they preserve\\nall symmetries of the tiling.  It then remains to show that (a)\\xa0the\\nlabels assigned do induce a division into the clusters shown, and\\n(b)\\xa0the clusters adjoin other clusters in accordance with the matching\\nrules.\\n\\nBoth (a) and\\xa0(b) may be demonstrated by a computer case analysis of\\n2-patches of hats.  This analysis is not very\\nsensitive to the precise list of 2-patches used, as long as it includes all\\n2-patches that can actually occur in a tiling.  It may also include\\nsome 2-patches that cannot occur in a tiling, since many such\\n2-patches do in fact ', \"also satisfy the conditions that need to be\\nchecked.  For the purposes of this proof we worked with the 188\\n“surroundable 2-patches”, i.e., 2-patches that can be surrounded\\nat least once more to form a 3-patch.  To generate this set of 188\\npatches we modified Kaplan's SAT-based software\\xa0<cit.> to\\nenumerate all distinct 3-patches of hats, and extracted the unique \\n2-patches in their centres.  We validated this list by creating an\\nindependent implementation based on brute-force search with backtracking;\\nthe source code for this implementation is available with our article.\\nA more sophisticated case analysis can be carried out to show that at most\\n63 of the 188 surroundable 2-patches can actually appear in a \\ntiling by hats. However, all 188 of them satisfy the conditions given\\nin this section, allowing us to obtain the results we need with simpler\\nand more transparent computations.\\n\\nIt is also possible to demonstrate both (a) and\\xa0(b) by a shorter \\ncase analysis using only 1-patches.  \\nHo\", 'wever, the analysis using only 1-patches is\\nmore complicated because the classification rules assume that all the\\nneighbours of a tile are known.  Those rules can therefore not be applied\\ndirectly to the outer tiles in a 1-patch, making it necessary to work\\nwith partial information about which labels are consistent with such a\\ntile.  For more details of this alternative case analysis, see\\nAppendix\\xa0<ref>. \\n\\nThe computer analyses of 2-patches and 1-patches depend on an\\nassumption that it is only necessary to consider tilings where all\\npolykites are aligned to the same underlying [3.4.6.4] Laves\\ntiling.  This assumption is not in fact obvious for tilings by\\npolykites or other polyforms in general; it is justified in\\nAppendix\\xa0<ref>.\\n\\nTo demonstrate\\xa0(a), for each of the kinds of cluster, form a connected\\ngraph whose vertices are the tiles of that cluster, and such that,\\nwhere the graph has an edge between two tiles, those tiles are\\nneighbours in the cluster.  (This does not uniquely determi', 'ne the\\ngraph for cluster\\xa0H; below we use a spanning tree where H_1\\xa0has\\nedges to each other tile.)  For each ordered pair L_1\\xa0and\\xa0L_2 of\\ntwo labels in a cluster, with an edge between their tiles in the graph\\nfor that cluster, we check (sec:clusters:within) that, in\\nevery 2-patch centred on a tile\\nwith label\\xa0L_1, there is a tile with label\\xa0L_2 in the expected\\nposition and orientation relative to that with label\\xa0L_1.  If this\\nrelationship\\nholds for all such pairs, for every 2-patch that might occur in a\\ntiling and that has L_1 at its centre, it follows that\\nthe labels assigned in any tiling do indeed induce a division into\\nclusters as desired.\\n\\nIn fact, the rules given do not distinguish between labels P_1\\nand\\xa0F_1; they assign all such tiles the common label\\xa0FP_1.\\nHowever, this does not affect the argument; it simply means that in a\\ncertain position and orientation relative to a tile\\xa0FP_1, there must\\nbe a tile that may be P_2 or\\xa0F_2, and, conversely, in a certain\\nposition and orientation ', \"relative to P_2 or\\xa0F_2, there must be a\\ntile\\xa0FP_1.  Given that this is true in all tilings, each\\xa0FP_1 tile\\nmay then be relabeled as F_1\\xa0or\\xa0P_1 based on whether its\\nneighbour is F_2 or\\xa0P_2.\\n\\nTo demonstrate\\xa0(b), for each marked edge segment (referred to here\\nas\\xa0E) of each kind of cluster (referred to here as\\xa0C), we identify\\nall the edge segments\\xa0E' in all the kinds of cluster\\xa0C' that could\\nadjoin it, consistent with the matching rules.  If any one tile\\nin\\xa0C' adjoining\\xa0E' is in the correct position and orientation\\nrelative to any one tile in\\xa0C that adjoins\\xa0E, it follows as a\\nresult of\\xa0(a) that the entire edge segment properly matches between\\nthe two clusters.  Furthermore, because the matching conditions on the\\nboundaries of F_1 and\\xa0P_1 are identical, it is not a problem that\\nthose are both handled as a single label\\xa0FP_1.  So for each\\xa0E we\\npick one tile in\\xa0C, and for each choice of\\xa0E', we pick one tile\\nin\\xa0C' that would be a neighbour of the tile picked in\\xa0C\\n(sec:clusters:between).  The\\nco\", \"mputer analysis of 2-patches then verifies that, in each 2-patch\\nwhose central tile has the label of the tile picked in\\xa0C, there is a\\nneighbour in a position and orientation and with a label that matches\\nthe tile picked in\\xa0C' for one choice of\\xa0E'.\\n\\nWe now present details of the classification rules for tiles, and of\\nthe exact checks implemented that satisfy the requirements described\\nabove: the ordered pairs of tiles in a spanning tree for each cluster,\\nand those associated with each edge segment of each cluster.\\nThe reference software implementation mentioned above also performs\\nall of these checks on the 188 surroundable 2-patches.\\n\\n §.§ Classification rules for the hat polykite\\n\\nEach diagram in Figure\\xa0<ref> shows a central tile and some\\nnumber of neighbours of that tile, and represents a classification\\nrule.  The order of the rules is significant; the first rule that\\nmatches determines the label on the central tile.  If all the\\nneighbours shown are present, and no previous rule matc\", \"hed, the tile\\nhas the label indicated.  The last rule has no neighbours shown, so\\nalways matches if no previous rule matched. Thus every tile is assigned\\nsome label.\\n\\n §.§ Within-cluster matching checks for the hat polykite\\n\\nEach diagram in Figure\\xa0<ref> shows a central tile (shaded)\\nand a neighbour, with labels on both.  The central tile in every\\n2-patch that can occur in a tiling should be checked against all\\nfigures shown here with that central tile's label on the shaded tile;\\nif, for all such 2-patches, the neighbour indicated is present with\\nthe correct label, then the labels assigned by the classification\\nrules do induce a division into the clusters shown, as explained\\nabove.\\n\\n §.§ Between-cluster matching checks for the hat polykite\\n\\nEach diagram in Figure\\xa0<ref> shows a central tile (shaded)\\nand a neighbour, with labels on both, and represents a tile on one\\nside of a cluster edge and some options for a tile on the other side\\nof that edge.  In some cases, there are two alternative\", \"s listed\\nfor the same edge, with separate figures for each, marked in the form\\n“(alternative\\xa0k of\\xa02)”.  Also, in some cases there are multiple \\noptions for the labels on one or both tiles, shown in a single figure.  The\\ncentral tile in every 2-patch that can occur in a tiling should be\\nchecked against all figures shown here with that central tile's label\\nas one of the options for the shaded tile; if, for all such\\n2-patches, one of the alternatives listed for that edge is present\\nwith one of the labels indicated, then the clusters adjoin other\\nclusters in accordance with the matching rules.  (Where multiple\\nalternatives are listed for the same edge, only one of those\\nalternatives needs to pass the check.)\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n§ A FOUR-TILE SUBSTITUTION SYSTEM\\n\\nConsider the four metatiles, with matching conditions as in\\nFigure\\xa0<ref>, which are depicted in this section in\\nthe form shown in Figure\\xa0<ref>.  Edges A are\\nred, B are\\nblue, X are\\ngreen, F are\\npink, and L are\\ngray.  Edges are marked with small\\ngeometrical decorations to indicate the signs (outward on the\\n^+\\xa0side, inward on the ^-\\xa0side): equilateral triangles\\nfor\\xa0A, semicircles for\\xa0B, orthogonal line segments for\\xa0X, short\\nslanted line segments for\\xa0F.  Note that the A and B on H are\\nthe opposite signs to those on T, P, and F.  Also note that the\\ntiles in this substitution system may not be reflected, only rotated.\\n\\n[x=5mm,y=5mm,ultra thick]\\n  000T;\\n  04-2H;\\n  010-5P;\\n  017-8.5F;\\n\\nMetatiles T, H, P, and F\\n\\nLater in the argument it is convenient to bisect some tiles\\xa0P\\nand\\xa0F, as shown in Figure\\xa0<ref>.

We also refer to the halves with a B^+\\xa0edge as the upper\\nhalves, and the other halves as the lower halves.  We will show the\\nfollowing:\\n\\nIn any tiling by the four metatiles, after such bisection of P\\nand\\xa0F metatiles, the metatiles fit together to form larger,\\ncombinatorially equivalent supertiles, thereby forming a substitution\\nsystem.

However, the bisected t', 'iles are convenient\\nfor proving that the supertiles obey matching rules equivalent to those\\nof the original tiles.  In particular, bisection causes adjacencies\\nbetween supertiles to be more clearly encoded in \\nthe boundaries of the supertiles themselves, without also relying on\\ninformation about forced tiles that are not part of the supertiles.\\nIn some situations it may be more useful to assign whole tiles to supertiles\\nat every level of substitution, with no bisection.  \\nFor example, these whole tiles may be more convenient for analyzing sizes\\nor growth rates of patches in the inflation process.\\nIf needed, we can\\ndefine a symmetry-preserving bijection between the supertiles\\nshown here and any alternative choice of supertiles that avoids bisection.\\n\\nDiagrams for analysis of cases should be interpreted as follows.\\nThere are some unnumbered tiles that define the case being considered,\\nthen some numbered tiles that are forced in the sequence given by\\ntheir numbers.  If it is then necessar', 'y to split into multiple cases,\\nthe position at which multiple choices of tile must be considered is\\nmarked on the diagram with a filled circle, and there are then\\nseparate diagrams for each choice (on which the previous forced tiles\\nare now unnumbered, but newly forced tiles are numbered).\\n\\nThe configuration in Figure\\xa0<ref>, referred to as\\xa0PP, often\\nappears in the case\\nanalysis; the two adjoining copies of\\xa0P in the same orientation\\nforce a contradiction because nothing fits at the marked point.\\nSubsequently, when identifying forced tiles, as well as considering a\\ntile as forced when it is the only one that would fit in a given place\\nconsistent with the matching conditions, we also consider a tile as\\nforced when the only alternative consistent with the matching\\nconditions would be to place a P\\xa0tile in a way that produces this\\xa0PP \\nconfiguration. \\n\\n[x=5mm,y=5mm,ultra thick]\\n  6000;\\n  6014;\\n  0201;\\n  0342;\\n  43;\\n\\nA common impossible configuration, referred to as PP\\n\\n §.§ Cases involving T', '\\n\\nThe two A^- edges of\\xa0T must be adjacent to the A^+ edge of\\xa0H,\\nwhile the B^+\\xa0edge of\\xa0T may be adjacent to either of the\\nB^-\\xa0edges of\\xa0H.

We now provide more detailed rules for allocating each H or\\nT tile, and, after bisecting all P and F tiles, each half of\\nsuch a tile, to groupings of tiles, such that each tile is allocated\\nto exactly one grouping, the groupings all have the form of one of the\\nsupertiles, all symmetries of the original tiling are also symmetries\\nof the tiling by supertiles (this property follows immediately from\\nthe form of the rules, which do not involve any arbitrary choices that\\ncould break symmetry), and the supertiles adjoin each other in\\naccordance with the matching conditions indicated (A^+_2 adjoinin\", \"g\\nA^-_2, B^+_2 adjoining B^-_2, X^+_2 adjoining X^-_2, F^+_2\\nadjoining F^-_2, and L_2 adjoining L_2).\\n\\n  \\n  * Each T tile is allocated to a H'\\xa0supertile, along with all\\n    the H\\xa0tiles adjacent to that T.\\n  \\n  * Each H tile in case HPP is allocated to a T'\\xa0supertile.\\n  \\n  * Each H tile in case HFP is allocated to a P'\\xa0supertile,\\n    along with the H\\xa0tile in case\\xa0HPF shown in\\n    Figure\\xa0<ref>.\\n  \\n  * Each H tile in case\\xa0HFF is allocated to an F'\\xa0supertile,\\n    along with the H\\xa0tile in case\\xa0HPF shown in\\n    Figure\\xa0<ref>.\\n  \\n  * Each H tile in case HPF was allocated to a supertile by\\n    exactly one of the previous two rules.\\n  \\n  * Each half of a P tile, and the upper half of each F\\xa0tile,\\n    is adjacent to exactly one H\\xa0tile along its A^- or B^+\\xa0edge,\\n    and is allocated to the same supertile as that H\\xa0tile.  (Where\\n    both halves are allocated to the same supertile, the bisection\\n    isn't shown in the diagrams of the supertiles, to simplify those\\n    diagrams.)\\n  \\n  * It remains to \", \"allocate the lower halves of F\\xa0tiles.  Each\\n    such lower half has a X^-\\xa0edge between a L\\xa0edge and a\\n    F^+\\xa0edge; it is allocated to the same supertile as the H\\xa0tile\\n    adjacent to that X^- edge.  For this allocation rule to be\\n\\twell defined, we need to show that this X^- edge is indeed\\n    adjacent to a H\\xa0tile.  The only other possibility not violating\\n    the matching rules would be adjacency to another F\\xa0tile, as\\n    shown in Figure\\xa0<ref>, but nothing fits at the marked point\\n    without violating the matching rules, so that cannot occur.\\n\\nThe X^- edge referenced in the last allocation rule cannot be\\nadjacent to any of the exposed X^+\\xa0edges of H\\xa0tiles in supertiles\\nT', P' or\\xa0F' without violating the matching rules.  Thus all\\nlower halves of F\\xa0tiles are the ones that appear on the diagrams of\\nthe supertiles, and we have shown that the tiling is partitioned into\\nthe supertiles.\\n\\n[x=5mm,y=5mm,ultra thick]\\n  000;\\n  1807-4;\\n  5-2;\\n\\nImpossible adjacency of two F tiles\\n\\nWe now show that\", \" the supertiles adjoin each other in accordance with\\nthe matching conditions indicated.  First, we examine P^+\\xa0edges\\n(appearing in A^-_2 and\\xa0B^-_2) and P^-\\xa0edges (appearing in\\nA^+_2 and\\xa0B^+_2).  B^-_2 and\\xa0A^+_2 appear only in\\xa0H', where\\ntheir P^+ and\\xa0P^-\\xa0edges cannot meet without tiles intersecting.\\nSo B^-_2 can only join to\\xa0B^+_2 and A^+_2 can only join to\\xa0A^-_2.\\n\\nNext we show that the converse holds: A^-_2 can only join to\\xa0A^+_2\\nand B^+_2 can only join to\\xa0B^-_2.  For a contradiction, suppose\\nthat the P^+ and P^- edges in some A^-_2 and\\xa0B^+_2 are joined.\\nIf the B^+_2 comes from a P'\\xa0supertile, then that P^- bisects\\ntile\\xa05 in case\\xa0HFP.  Adjacent tiles 5 and\\xa01 in that configuration\\nboth have B^+\\xa0edges, which must both be adjacent to H\\xa0tiles; those\\nH\\xa0tiles are adjacent to each other, which can only occur in a\\nsupertile\\xa0H', which does not have an A^-_2\\xa0edge.  The same\\nargument applies in the case of an F'\\xa0supertile, considering tiles 6\\nand\\xa02 in case\\xa0HFF.  If the\\xa0P^+ in an\\xa0A^-_2 from\\xa0P' is \", \"joined\\nto a\\xa0B^+_2, a similar argument applies (considering tile 2 and an\\nadjacent unnumbered tile in case\\xa0HFP).  So the only remaining case\\nwould be if both edges come from supertile\\xa0T', but that is\\ninconsistent with the F\\xa0tiles forced in case\\xa0HPP.\\n\\nHaving shown that A^+_2, A^-_2, B^+_2, and B^-_2 must meet the\\nmatching conditions for the supertiles, now note that the only X^+\\nand X^- edges on the boundaries of the supertiles that are not part\\nof A^+_2, A^-_2, B^+_2 or B^-_2 are those forming part of\\nF^+_2 and\\xa0F^-_2.  Thus it follows that F^+_2 and\\xa0F^-_2 must\\nalso adjoin each other.  The only remaining G^+ and\\xa0G^- edges of\\nthe tiles are then those that form X^-_2 and X^+_2 edges of the\\nsupertiles, so those also match, and the remaining L\\xa0edges\\nform\\xa0L_2, so those also match.\\n\\nTo show that the supertiles are fully combinatorially equivalent to\\nthe original tiles, one more thing must be checked: that the same\\ncombinations of supertiles fit together at vertices as combinations of\\ntiles fit\", ' together at vertices.  Each supertile has been drawn with a\\ncopy of the corresponding tile alongside it, in a corresponding\\norientation.  By inspection, if you take any class of edges of the\\ntiles, including both sides of the edge (for example, A^+ and\\nA^-), and take any line segment in the corresponding edges of the\\nsupertiles, the (directed) angle between the (directed) edges in the\\ntile and in the supertile is consistent across all the diagrams.\\n\\nThis consistency of angles between edges of tiles and of supertiles\\nmeans that the angles at vertices of supertiles around a point, each\\nconsecutive pair having matching edges, add up to the same amount as\\nthe corresponding angles for the corresponding tiles (an angle at a\\nvertex of a supertile equals the angle at the corresponding vertex of\\nthe corresponding tile, plus the difference between the\\ntile–supertile angles for the two edges, and those differences cancel\\nwhen adding up around the point).\\n\\nSo the supertiles are combinatorially eq', 'uivalent to the tiles, and thus\\nthe above arguments apply inductively to ensure that the composition\\nof tiles into supertiles may be applied n\\xa0times for all\\xa0n.  Since\\nthe radius of a ball contained in the supertiles goes to infinity\\nwith\\xa0n (and this does not depend on how the bisection of supertiles\\nis defined geometrically, although it may be easier to see if an\\nalternative choice of supertiles is made at this stage that does not\\ninvolve bisecting tiles), and the tilings by supertiles have all the\\nsymmetries of the original tiling, it follows that the original tiling\\ncannot have a translation as a symmetry.  Furthermore, the\\nsubstitution structure implies that the metatiles tile arbitrarily\\nlarge finite regions of the plane, and hence the whole plane.\\n', '\\n\\n§ A FAMILY OF APERIODIC MONOTILES\\n\\nIn the previous sections, we showed that the hat polykite\\nis an aperiodic monotile.  This polykite is\\nformed of 8\\xa0kites from the [3.4.6.4] Laves tiling.  Another small\\npolykite, formed of 10\\xa0kites and shown in Figure\\xa0<ref>, is\\nalso aperiodic.  We have verified via a computer search that there are no \\nother aperiodic n-kites for n ≤ 21.\\n\\n[x=5mm,y=5mm]\\n  000;\\n\\nAn aperiodic 10-kite\\n\\nThese two aperiodic polykites are two examples of a family of\\naperiodic monotiles, all of which have combinatorially equivalent sets\\nof tilings, and which are determined by the choice of two side\\nlengths.\\n\\nThe hat polykite has sides of lengths 1, 2, and\\xa0√(3); for the\\npurposes of this section, we consider the side of length\\xa02 as two\\nconsecutive sides of length\\xa01 with a 180^∘\\xa0angle between them.\\nThe tile of Figure\\xa0<ref> has the same angles, but with the\\nside lengths of 1 and\\xa0√(3) swapped.\\n\\nLet a and\\xa0b be nonnegative reals, not both zero, and if a 0\\nwrite r = b / a.\\nDefine Til', 'e(a, b) to be the polygon resulting from replacing the sides of\\nlength\\xa01 in the hat polykite with sides of length\\xa0a (we\\nrefer to the resulting sides as 1-sides) and replacing the\\nsides of length\\xa0√(3) in the hat polykite with sides of\\nlength\\xa0b (we refer to the resulting sides as r-sides).\\nThis process results in a closed curve (because the vectors of the\\n1-sides add up to\\xa00, as do those of the r-sides), and it is also\\nstraightforward to see that this curve is not self-intersecting; it is\\na 13-gon (or one with a smaller number of sides if a or\\xa0b is\\nzero), but considered as a 14-gon for the purposes of this section.\\nThis tile has area\\xa0√(3)(2a^2+√(3)ab+b^2).  The hat polykite\\nis then Tile(1, √(3)) in this notation, while the tile of\\nFigure\\xa0<ref> is Tile(√(3), 1).\\n\\nFor nonzero\\xa0a, the value \\nof\\xa0r determines the tile up to similarity.  In acknowledgment of \\nthese similarity classes, we write Tile(r) as a\\nshorthand for Tile(1,r).  We will show this tile is\\naperiodic for any positive r  1.\\nIn f', 'act, Tile(1, k√(3)) and Tile(k√(3),\\n1) are polykites for all odd positive integers\\xa0k, so this continuum\\nof aperiodic monotiles also contains a countably infinite family of\\naperiodic polykites.\\n\\n[x=5mm,y=5mm]\\n  10000;\\n  1-1230;\\n  1-2460;\\n  1-3690;\\n  13-21-2;\\n  1204-2;\\n  1127-2;\\n  10410-2;\\n  14-26-6;\\n  1309-6;\\n  12212-6;\\n  11415-6;\\n  17-47-8;\\n  16-210-8;\\n  15013-8;\\n  14216-8;\\n\\nPeriodic tiling by Tile(1, 1)\\n\\nWe define a notion of combinatorial equivalence between tilings of\\nthese tiles, for two positive values of\\xa0r, as follows: two tilings\\nare combinatorially equivalent if there exists a bijection between\\ntheir tiles, and a bijection between the maximal line segments in the\\nunions of the boundaries of the tiles, such that corresponding tiles\\nand line segments in the two tilings are in the same orientation,\\ncorresponding tiles adjoin corresponding line segments, on the same\\nside of those line segments, in the two tilings, and corresponding\\ntiles on the corresponding sides of corresponding ', \"line segments appear\\nin the same order along those segments.  All the interior angles of\\nthe tile are at least\\xa090^∘, and no two 90^∘\\xa0angles appear\\nconsecutively, so any maximal line segment has at most two sides of\\ntiles on each side of the line segment (and in particular is finite).\\n\\nWe now prove the following result:\\n\\nSuppose r  1 and r' 1 are positive.  Then there is a\\nbijection between combinatorially equivalent tilings for Tile(r) and\\nTile(r'), given by changing the lengths of all r-sides from r\\nto\\xa0r', while preserving angles, orientations and adjacency to\\nmaximal line segments.\\n\\nSuppose first that r is irrational. \\nIf a maximal line segment in the union of the\\nboundaries of the tiles has p\\xa01-sides and q\\xa0r-sides on one\\nside of the line segment, it also has p\\xa01-sides and q\\xa0r-sides\\non the other side of the line segment. Because a maximal line segment\\nhas at most two sides of tiles on each side of the segment, the same\\nargument also applies for any rational\\xa0r except possibly 1/2, 1,\\n\", 'and\\xa02.\\n\\nIf r = 2, there is the additional possibility that two 1-sides\\nalign with one r-side.  When there are two consecutive 1-sides on\\none side of a line, with 90^∘\\xa0corners of the two tiles between\\nthose two sides (or the 180^∘\\xa0corner of a single tile), the\\nother ends of those sides have corners with angles 120^∘\\nor\\xa0240^∘.  But for every r-side, one corner has angle\\n90^∘ or\\xa0270^∘, and the angles of the tile do not permit\\n120^∘ or 240^∘ at the same vertex of a tiling as\\n90^∘ or\\xa0270^∘.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the case r = 1/2, the only additional\\npossibility is that two r-sides align with one 1-side.  The outer\\ncorners of the two r-sides have angles 120^∘ or\\xa0240^∘,\\none corner of every 1-side has angle 90^∘, 180^∘\\nor\\xa0270^∘, and those cannot appear at the same vertex.\\n\\nThus for any positive r 1, we have shown that if a maximal line segment \\nin the union of the boundaries of the tiles has p\\xa01-sides and\\nq\\xa0r-sides on one side of the line segment, it also has\\np\\xa01-sides and q\\xa0r-sides on the other side', \" of the line segment.\\nWe can now construct the required bijection.  Because side vectors\\naround any tile add up to zero, and\\nthe sides of tiles on both sides of a maximal line segment add up to\\nthe same length, the specified process converts a tiling by Tile(r) into one\\nby Tile(r') that is combinatorially equivalent\\xa0<cit.>.\\n\\n(This argument relies on the fact that the plane is simply connected;\\na tiling by Tile(r) of a region with a hole that cannot be filled\\nwith tiles might not convert to a tiling by Tile(r') of a region with\\na combinatorially equivalent hole, and indeed the side vectors of the\\nhole might be such that no combinatorially equivalent hole exists, if\\nthe vectors of the 1-sides among the sides of the hole do not add up\\nto\\xa00.)\\n\\nAs shown in Lemma\\xa0<ref>, all tilings by\\nTile(√(3)) are aligned to an underlying [3.4.6.4] Laves tiling,\\nso in fact each maximal line segment is made up only of 1-sides or\\nonly of r-sides.\\n\\nFinally, Tile(1), or more generally Tile(a, a), is not aperio\", 'dic, as shown by the periodic tiling in\\nFigure\\xa0<ref>.  The polyiamonds Tile(a, 0) and\\nTile(0, b) are also not aperiodic.  A tiling by Tile(r) for\\npositive r 1 can still be mapped to a corresponding tiling by\\nTile(a, a), Tile(a, 0) or Tile(0, b) following the process\\ndescribed above, but the map is not a bijection.\\n', '\\n\\n§ CONCLUSION\\n\\nWe have exhibited an einstein, the first topological disk that tiles\\naperiodically with no additional constraints or matching conditions.\\nThe hat polykite is in fact a member of a continuous family of aperiodic\\nmonotiles that admit combinatorially equivalent tilings.\\nThe hat forces\\ntilings with hierarchical structure, as is the case for many aperiodic\\nsets of tiles in the plane, but a new method introduced in\\nsec:coupling also suffices to show the lack of periodic\\ntilings without needing that hierarchical structure, beyond\\ndemonstrating the existence of a tiling.\\n\\nThe hat is a 13-sided non-convex polygon.  A convex polygon cannot\\nbe an aperiodic monotile, and all non-convex quadrilaterals can \\neasily be seen to tile periodically.  Therefore, in terms of number of \\nsides, the “simplest” aperiodic n-gon must have 5≤ n ≤ 13.\\nSubsequent research could chip away at this range, by finding aperiodic\\nn-gons for n<13 or ruling them out for n≥ 5.\\n\\nFinding such a monotile pushes t', 'he boundaries of complexity known to\\nbe achievable by the tiling behaviour of a single closed topological\\ndisk.  It does not, however, settle various other unresolved\\nquestions about that complexity.  For example, all of the following\\nquestions remain open.\\n\\n  \\n  * Are Heesch numbers unbounded?  That is, does there exist, for\\n  \\tevery positive integer n, a topological disk that does not tile the \\n\\tplane and has Heesch number at least n?  We conjecture that there is\\n\\tno bound on Heesch numbers.\\n\\n  \\n  * Are isohedral numbers unbounded?  That is, does there exist, for\\n  \\tevery positive integer n, a topological disk that tiles the plane \\n\\tperiodically\\n\\tbut only admits tilings with at least n transitivity classes?  Again,\\n\\twe conjecture that no bound exists.  If the requirement of periodicity\\n\\tis omitted here, then the hat polykite requires infinitely many \\n\\ttransitivity classes in any tiling. \\n\\tSocolar\\xa0<cit.> showed that if the tile is not required to be\\n    a closed topological disk, then', ' tiles exist with every positive\\n\\tisohedral number.\\n\\n  \\n  * Is it undecidable whether a single closed topological disk (or\\n    indeed a more general single tile in the plane) admits a tiling?\\n    It would again be reasonable to conjecture yes, which would also\\n    imply unbounded Heesch numbers.  Greenfeld and\\n    Tao\\xa0<cit.> demonstrated undecidability in a more general\\n    context.  For sets of tiles in the plane, Ollinger\\xa0<cit.>\\n    proved  undecidability for sets of five polyominoes.\\n\\n  \\n  * Is it undecidable whether a single closed topological disk (or\\n    indeed a more general single tile in the plane) admits a periodic\\n    tiling?  It would again be reasonable to conjecture yes.  Such\\n    an answer would imply unbounded isohedral numbers.\\n\\nAlthough we have provided a complete classification of tilings by the\\nhat polykite and related tiles described here (all such tilings are\\ngiven by the substitution system of sec:subst, as applied to\\nthe clusters of tiles from sec:clusters), the', 're are various\\ninformal observations in sec:discussion that have not been\\nfully explored or given a precise statement.  Those observations could\\nprovide starting points for possible future investigation of the tiles\\ndescribed here and their tilings, the metatiles used in classifying\\ntilings by the hat polykite, and other related substitution tilings.\\nIt is not clear which ideas from this work will be most promising for\\nfuture work, so we have generally erred on the side of including \\nobservations that might be of use, rather than making the paper focus\\nmore narrowly on a single proof of a single main result.\\n\\nWe believe the approach of sec:coupling, of coupling two\\nseparate tilings to show that a third tiling cannot be periodic, is a\\nnew approach for proving such a result about plane tilings.  It would\\nbe worth investigating whether it can be applied to other tiles and\\ntilings.  In particular, polykites (and, more generally,\\npoly-[4.6.12]-tiles, a subset of the shapes known as\\npolydraf', 'ters) may be unusually well-suited to this method of\\nproof, because their edges can naturally be split into those falling\\nin two sets of lines, with each set of lines forming a regular\\ntriangular tiling. It might also be applicable to some\\npoly-[4.8.8]-tiles (a subset of the\\npolyaboloes).[Note that if Lemma\\xa0<ref> is\\napplied to poly-[4.6.12]-tiles or poly-[4.8.8]-tiles, the\\nconclusion is weaker than that of Lemma\\xa0<ref> for\\npolykites, so tilings may need to be considered that are only aligned\\nin such a weaker sense.]  This style of proof might help explain how\\nsmall polykites\\nproved to be aperiodic when polyominoes, polyiamonds and polyhexes up\\nto high orders yielded no aperiodic monotiles.  However, as noted in\\nsec:family, searches of polykites have not found other\\naperiodic examples outside the family described in this paper.\\n', '\\n\\n§ ALIGNED AND UNALIGNED TILINGS OF POLYFORMS\\n\\nThe proof that the hat polykite is aperiodic\\ninvolves a case analysis for ways of surrounding a copy of that tile,\\nand that case analysis in turn involves considering possibilities for\\nhow an individual kite in a copy of the hat polykite could fill a\\nparticular kite on an underlying [3.4.6.4] Laves tiling.  By itself\\na proof founded on such a case analysis shows the absence of\\nperiodic tilings only when all tiles are aligned to the same \\nunderlying [3.4.6.4] Laves tiling.  This argument leaves open the\\npossibility that polykites might be able to tile periodically if they\\nmay be translated, rotated and reflected without regard to the underlying grid.\\nHere we\\nprovide the necessary justification that it is sufficient to consider\\naligned tilings: for classes of polyforms that include\\npolykites, if a tile admits a periodic tiling then it also admits one\\nthat is aligned (in a suitable precisely defined sense); the same is\\nalso shown for some ot', 'her tiling properties such as “isohedral” in\\nplace of “periodic”, although for the purposes of the main result of\\nthe paper, this fact is needed only for the “periodic” case (in which case\\nthe result and proof are slightly simpler).  We further show that the\\nhat in particular does not admit any unaligned tilings.\\n\\nIn principle, the same issue arises for polyominoes and polyiamonds.\\nHowever, the only unaligned tilings by congruent squares consist of\\nparallel rows of squares slid relative to each other\\n(Figure\\xa0<ref>), and much the same applies to tilings\\nby congruent equilateral triangles (Figure\\xa0<ref>),\\nand so it is clear that no interesting examples of unaligned tilings\\nby polyominoes or polyiamonds can arise.\\nHowever, kites can form nontrivial unaligned tilings such as that of\\nFigure\\xa0<ref>, and so there is genuinely something to\\nbe proved here, less obvious than it is for polyominoes and\\npolyiamonds.\\n\\n[x=1cm,y=1cm]\\n  00;\\n  10;\\n  20;\\n  30;\\n  40;\\n  50;\\n  0.21;\\n  1.21;\\n  2.21;\\n  3.21;\\n  ', '4.21;\\n  -0.12;\\n  0.92;\\n  1.92;\\n  2.92;\\n  3.92;\\n  4.92;\\n\\nSliding rows of squares\\n\\n[x=1cm,y=1cm]\\n  000;\\n  -6001;\\n  001;\\n  -6002;\\n  002;\\n  -6003;\\n  003;\\n  -6004;\\n  004;\\n  01-0.7;\\n  -6010.3;\\n  010.3;\\n  -6011.3;\\n  011.3;\\n  -6012.3;\\n  012.3;\\n  -6013.3;\\n  013.3;\\n  02-1.3;\\n  -602-0.3;\\n  02-0.3;\\n  -6020.7;\\n  020.7;\\n  -6021.7;\\n  021.7;\\n  -6022.7;\\n  022.7;\\n\\nSliding columns of equilateral triangles\\n\\n[x=5mm,y=5mm]\\n  0000;\\n  -1200000;\\n  -602-200;\\n  04-200;\\n  604000;\\n  1202200;\\n  1800200;\\n  2-420;\\n  4-202;\\n  22-22;\\n  -24-20;\\n  -420-2;\\n  -2-22-2;\\n  -1202-420;\\n  -606-402;\\n  060-22;\\n  6024-20;\\n  120-240-2;\\n  180-202-2;\\n\\nUnaligned tiling of kites\\n\\nIn order to apply the results presented here to other classes of \\npolyforms such as polyaboloes,\\nwe state the required conditions on the tiles in fairly general and\\ntechnical form.\\n\\nLet S be a set of real numbers that are linearly\\nindependent over\\xa0ℚ.  Let 𝒫 be a finite set of\\nclosed topological disk polygonal tiles, such that all the angles\\nof corners of tiles ', 'in\\xa0𝒫 are rational sub-multiples of\\xa0π,\\nall the lengths of sides of tiles in\\xa0𝒫 are integer\\nmultiples of elements of\\xa0S, and such that, if a polygon\\nin\\xa0𝒫 has two or more collinear sides,\\nthe lengths of those sides are integer multiples of the same element\\nof\\xa0S, as are the distances between their endpoints.\\n\\nWe now consider clusters of tiles built using copies of the polygons\\nin 𝒫.  Let 𝒬 be a nonempty set of tiles, each\\none congruent\\nto one of the polygons in 𝒫, with disjoint interiors.  \\nThe set 𝒬 may cover the entire plane, or just part of it.\\nThe union of the boundaries of the tiles in 𝒬 decomposes\\ninto a set of maximal line segments, rays, and infinite lines, which we will\\nrefer to generically as segments.  These segments are maximal\\nin the sense that no segment is a subset of a longer line contained in\\nthe union of the tile boundaries.\\n\\nGiven one such maximal segment\\xa0ℓ, and two tiles A, B∈𝒬\\n(which may be identical), we say that A and\\xa0B are ℓ-aligned\\nif they both have sides that are su', 'bsets of\\xa0ℓ, all sides of A\\nor\\xa0B that lie in\\xa0ℓ have lengths that are integer multiples of\\nthe same s∈ S, and the distance between any endpoint of\\none of those sides that lies in\\xa0ℓ and any other such endpoint is\\nalso an integer multiple of\\xa0s.\\n\\nThe set 𝒬 naturally induces a graph whose vertices correspond\\nto the tiles in the set.  Two tiles A and B are connected by an edge\\nin the graph if there is a maximal segment\\xa0ℓ such that A and B\\nare ℓ-aligned and intersect in a line segment of positive length\\nthat is a subset of ℓ.\\nWe say that 𝒬 is weakly aligned if this graph is \\nconnected.  We say that it is strongly aligned if it is weakly \\naligned and, for every maximal segment\\xa0ℓ determined by 𝒬,\\nand all tiles A and\\xa0B that have sides\\nlying in\\xa0ℓ, A and\\xa0B are ℓ-aligned.  We say that\\n𝒫 has the alignment property for side\\nlengths\\xa0S if every weakly aligned set is strongly\\naligned.  Here we drop the qualifiers “strongly” and “weakly” and refer \\nto 𝒬, given the combination\\nof\\xa0𝒫 and\\xa0S, simply as aligned', '.\\n\\nAny finite set of polykites, where the underlying kites have side\\nlengths 1 and\\xa0√(3), has the alignment property for side\\nlengths {1,√(3)}.\\n\\nIn the Laves tiling [3.4.6.4], subdivide each kite into\\n30^∘–60^∘–90^∘ triangles as shown in\\nFigure\\xa0<ref>, forming a [4.6.12]\\nLaves tiling.  Furthermore, if a kite congruent to\\none of those from the original [3.4.6.4] adjoins edge-to-edge a kite\\nthat is a union of triangles from that [4.6.12] tiling, then it too\\nis such a union.  Thus all polykites\\nin any weakly aligned set are unions of tiles from the same [4.6.12]\\ntiling.  On any line in the union of the boundaries of the tiles from\\n[4.6.12] that contains sides with rational length, sides of such\\nkites can only be at integer offsets from each other, and on the other\\nlines (containing sides with length a rational multiple\\nof\\xa0√(3)), sides of such kites can only be at offsets from each\\nother that are integer multiples of\\xa0√(3) (both of these facts\\nfollow from consideration of which vertices have ', 'the correct angles to\\nform a corner of such a kite).  So every weakly aligned set is\\nstrongly aligned.\\n\\n[x=1cm,y=1cm]\\n  00 – 3-3 – 60 –\\n    03 – cycle;\\n  00 – 60;\\n  3-3 – 31.5;\\n  03 – 4.5-1.5;\\n  3-3 – 03;\\n  4-2 – 22;\\n  5-1 – 41;\\n  00 – 22;\\n  1.5-1.5 – 41;\\n  00 – 4-2;\\n  01.5 – 5-1;\\n\\nDecomposition of a kite into 24\\xa0triangles\\n\\nWe now consider 𝒫 that has the alignment property for side\\nlengths\\xa0S, and proceed to showing that, in an appropriate\\nsense, only aligned tilings need to be considered.  Note that for\\npolykites, at this point “aligned” means only that the kites adjoin\\nedge-to-edge, which is weaker than all tiles coming from the same\\nunderlying [3.4.6.4] tiling; there will be further lemmas specific\\nto polykites to show that we need only consider tilings where all\\ntiles come from the same underlying [3.4.6.4].\\n\\nThe alignment property implies that the tiles of any tiling can be\\npartitioned into strongly aligned sets such that for any maximal line\\nsegment\\xa0ℓ in the union of the boundarie', 's of the tiles, and any\\ntwo tiles in different sets that have sides sharing a segment of\\npositive length lying on\\xa0ℓ, those two tiles are not\\nℓ-aligned.  We refer to these as the aligned components of\\nthe tiling.  Each aligned component is a connected set (possibly\\nunbounded), with connected interior.\\n\\nSuppose 𝒞 is an aligned component in a tiling, and\\n𝒟\\xa0is a connected component of the complement\\nof\\xa0𝒞 (𝒟 might be the interior of another\\naligned component, or might be the interior of the union of more than\\none aligned component).  The boundary of\\xa0𝒟 consists of a single\\npolygonal curve, either closed or infinite, and as with any other\\npolygon we may speak of its corners and sides.  Furthermore, that\\ncurve cannot pass through the same point more than once; if it did,\\neither 𝒟 (an open set) would not be connected, or\\n𝒞 would not have connected interior.\\n\\nConsider traversing the boundary of\\xa0𝒟; note that\\n𝒟 always lies on the same side of the boundary during that\\ntraversal.  When the traversal', '\\nencounters a corner, say that corner is convex if an open line segment\\nbetween two points on the curve sufficiently close to that corner but\\non opposite sides of it is entirely within\\xa0𝒟.\\n\\nWhen the boundary of\\xa0𝒟 is a closed curve, we must also\\ninitially allow for 𝒟 being inside that curve (a hole\\nin\\xa0𝒞) or outside (in which case 𝒞 is\\nbounded).  The following lemma shows that the first of those cases\\ncannot occur, since if 𝒟 is inside the curve it must have\\nat least three convex corners.\\n\\nThe boundary of\\xa0𝒟 has no convex corners if it is a closed\\ncurve (so in that case 𝒞 must be a bounded convex set),\\nand at most one convex corner if it is an infinite curve.\\n\\nIf we consider any finite side of the\\nboundary of\\xa0𝒟, lying in some maximal line segment\\xa0ℓ,\\nall the tiles lying on the other side of the side from\\xa0𝒟\\nare not ℓ-aligned with any of those in\\xa0𝒟, meaning\\nthat at least one of the two corners at the ends of that side lies in\\nthe middle of a side of such a tile.  If v\\xa0is a convex corner, and\\n', 'v_1, v_2, … are successive vertices traversing the boundary\\ncurve in one direction from\\xa0v, then we conclude that v_1\\xa0lies in\\nthe middle of a side of a tile on the same line as\\xa0vv_1, then that\\nv_2\\xa0lies in the middle of a side of a tile on the same line\\nas\\xa0v_1v_2, and so on.  This results in a contradiction if we\\nencounter another convex corner (see Figure\\xa0<ref> for an\\nillustration), or encounter v\\xa0again on a closed curve (see\\nFigure\\xa0<ref>).\\n\\n[x=1cm,y=1cm]\\n  (0,0) – (1,0) – (2,1) – (3,1) – (4,0) – (5,0);\\n  (3,1) – (2.5,1.5);\\n  (2,1) – (1.5,1);\\n  (4.2,0.2) node v;\\n  (3.2,1.2) node v_1;\\n  (1.8,1.2) node v_2;\\n\\nBoundary curve with two convex corners\\n\\n[x=1cm,y=1cm]\\n  (0,0) – (1,0.5) – (2,0) – (2.5,2) – (0,1.5) – cycle;\\n  (2,0) – (2.5,-0.25);\\n  (2.5,2) – (2.625,2.5);\\n  (0,1.5) – (-0.5,1.4);\\n  (0,0) – (0,-0.5);\\n  (0.9,0.1) node v;\\n  (1.9,-0.2) node v_1;\\n  (2.75,1.9) node v_2;\\n  (0,1.7) node v_3;\\n  (-0.3,0) node v_4;\\n\\nClosed boundary curve with a convex corner\\n\\nNow we need to list the tiling pro', 'perties for which our argument says\\nwe do not need to consider unaligned tilings.

By the previous lemma,\\nsuch components must be simply connected; either bounded, or unbounded\\nand with each boundary curve having at most one convex corner (in the\\nsense defined above, i.e., convex considered as a corner of a\\nconnected component of the complement of the aligned component).\\n\\nIf such a component is the whole plane, the', ' tiling is aligned and we\\nare done.  If it is a half-plane, form an aligned tiling of that\\ncomponent and its reflection, and that tiling has property\\xa0H (which\\ncan only be the trivial property or “weakly periodic” in that case).\\nIf it is a strip infinite in both directions, with straight lines as\\nits boundaries on both sides, repeat that strip by translation if\\nthere is such a tiling that is aligned, and otherwise repeat it by\\n180^∘ rotation; by considering separately for each possible\\npredicate\\xa0H, the resulting aligned tiling has property\\xa0H.\\n\\nOtherwise, if there is any unbounded component, it does not have a\\ntranslation as a symmetry and H\\xa0is the trivial predicate.  If an\\nunbounded component contains balls of radius\\xa0R for all\\xa0R, there\\nare aligned tilings of arbitrarily large regions of the plane, and so\\nof the whole plane.  The only way an unbounded component can avoid\\ncontaining such balls (given that each boundary curve has at most one\\nconvex corner and all angles are rational sub-mu', \"ltiples of\\xa0π, which\\nimplies that all boundary curves end in rays in finitely many\\ndirections) is for it to include a semi-infinite strip (bounded on\\neither side by rays).  But there are only finitely many ways for\\naligned tiles to cross the width of the strip at any point, so tiling\\na semi-infinite strip implies the existence of a periodic aligned\\ntiling of an infinite strip, and thus a periodic aligned tiling of the\\nwhole plane.\\n\\nIt remains to consider the case where there is no unbounded component.\\nIf some component is a triangle or a quadrilateral, tiling that by\\n180^∘\\xa0rotation yields an aligned tiling of the whole plane,\\nwhich must have property\\xa0H (if property\\xa0H is `isohedral tiling by\\ntranslation', this case cannot occur; a component could be an infinite\\nstrip, but not a single parallelogram).  If components contain\\nunbounded balls, the tiling has no translation as a symmetry and\\naligned tilings of arbitrarily large regions of the plane imply\\naligned tilings of the whole plane.  I\", 'f components do not contain\\nunbounded balls but also are not contained in bounded balls (i.e.,\\nthey are of unbounded size in one direction only), they must have\\npairs of opposite parallel sides, of unbounded length but a bounded\\ndistance apart; the tiling is at most weakly periodic, and the same\\nargument as for components including a semi-infinite strip applies\\nsince there are only finitely many possible distances between those\\nopposite parallel sides.\\n\\nOtherwise, all components are convex polygons of bounded size with at\\nleast five sides; we will show this case leads to a contradiction.  \\nObserve that every\\nvertex of the induced tiling by these polygons lies in the middle of a\\nside of one of the polygons and has degree exactly\\xa03.\\nIf a vertex does not lie in the middle of a side, or has\\ndegree 4 or more, there is a vertex\\xa0v of a polygon\\xa0P, either not\\nin the middle of a side or in the middle of a side that is not\\ncollinear with either of the sides vv_1 and vv_2 of\\xa0P next\\nto\\xa0v, and the s', \"ame argument that excluded convex corners on a closed\\ncurve earlier serves to exclude this possibility as well.\\n\\nWe now apply Euler's theorem for plane maps.  Suppose, for some\\nsufficiently large\\xa0R, a ball of radius\\xa0R contains t_k components\\nthat are k-gons (where ∑_k t_k = Ω(R^2)).  A vertex of the\\ntiling is incident with two corners of tiles and a point in the middle\\nof a side, so there are ∑_k k t_k / 2 + O(R) vertices in that\\nball.  The number of sides of edges in the tiling in that ball (i.e.,\\ntwice the number of edges) is ∑_k 3/2k t_k + O(R), since\\nthere are ∑_k k t_k + O(R) sides of polygons, and each vertex is\\nin the middle of a side so serves to increase the number of sides of\\nedges by\\xa01.  But now ∑_k t_k + ∑_k k t_k / 2 = ∑_k\\n3/4k t_k + O(R), so ∑_k t_k = ∑_k k t_k / 4 + O(R).\\nSince all k ≥ 5, we have ∑_k k t_k / 4 ≥∑_k 5/4\\nt_k, contradicting that equality.\\n\\nNow we strengthen this lemma to a stricter notion of aligned tilings by\\npolykites, by considering what edge-to-edge til\", 'ings by the monokite\\nare possible.\\n\\nThe only edge-to-edge tilings by the monokite are (a) the tiling\\nresulting from a 180^∘\\xa0rotation about the midpoint of each side\\n(Figure\\xa0<ref>), and (b) tilings composed of rows of\\nequilateral triangles each composed of three kites, where some of\\nthose rows may be slid relative to each other (by the length of the\\nlong side of the kite) so they are no longer aligned as in the Laves\\ntiling.\\n\\n[x=2mm,y=2mm]\\n  000;\\n  180-1.50;\\n  011;\\n  180-0.51;\\n  022;\\n  1800.52;\\n  01.5-1.5;\\n  1800-1.5;\\n  02.5-0.5;\\n  1801-0.5;\\n  03.50.5;\\n  18020.5;\\n  03-3;\\n  1801.5-3;\\n  04-2;\\n  1802.5-2;\\n  05-1;\\n  1803.5-1;\\n\\n180^∘ tiling by kites\\n\\nThere are exactly two possible vertex figures in an edge-to-edge\\ntiling by the monokite that do not appear in the Laves tiling: one\\nwith angles of 90^∘, 120^∘, 90^∘, and 60^∘ in\\nthat order (Figure\\xa0<ref>), and one with angles of\\n90^∘, 90^∘, 60^∘, 60^∘, and 60^∘ in that\\norder (Figure\\xa0<ref>).

This analysis can be used to complete a variant of the\\nproof in sec:clusters that,\\nwhen tiles in a tiling by the hat polykite\\nare assigned labels following the rules given there, (a)\\xa0the labels\\nassigned do induce a division into the clusters shown, and (b)\\xa0the\\nclusters adjoin other clusters in accordance with the matching rules.\\nAs is justified in Appendix\\xa0<ref>, we only consider tilings\\nwhere all tiles are aligned with an underlying [3.4.6.4] Laves\\ntiling.\\n\\n §.§ Enumeration of neighbours\\n\\nFirst we produce a list of possible neighbours of the hat polykite in a\\ntiling.  There are 58\\xa0possible neighbours when we only require such\\na neighbour not to intersect the original polykite; these are shown in\\nFigure\\xa0<ref>, with that original polykite shaded.  The first\\n41 of these neighbours remain in consideration for the e', 'numeration\\nof 1-patches.  The final\\xa017 are immediately eliminated (in the\\norder shown) because they cannot be extended to a tiling: either there\\nis no possible neighbour that can contain the shaded kite (without\\nresulting in an intersection, or a pair of tiles that were previously\\neliminated as possible neighbours), or we eliminated Y as a\\nneighbour of\\xa0X and so can also eliminate X as a neighbour of\\xa0Y.\\n\\n §.§ Enumeration of 1-patches\\n\\nHaving produced a list of possible neighbours, we now proceed to\\nenumerating possible 1-patches.  When we have a partial 1-patch\\n(some number of neighbours for the original, shaded polykite), we pick\\nsome kite neighbouring that original polykite and enumerate the\\npossible neighbouring polykites containing that kite, excluding any\\nthat would result in the patch containing two polykites that either\\nintersect or form a pair of neighbours previously ruled out; the kite\\nwe use is chosen so that the number of choices for the neighbour added\\nis minimal.  This pro', 'cess results in 37\\xa0possible 1-patches; the\\npartial patches from the search process are shown in\\nFigure\\xa0<ref> and the 1-patches are shown in\\nFigures\\xa0<ref>.\\n\\nSome of the 1-patches found can be immediately eliminated at this\\npoint, by identifying a tile in the 1-patch that cannot itself be\\nsurrounded by any of the 1-patches (that has not yet been\\neliminated) without resulting in either an intersection or a pair of\\nneighbours that were previously ruled out.  In the 12 cases \\nimplicated here, the tile that cannot be surrounded is shaded, and they are\\neliminated in the order shown, leaving 25\\xa0remaining 1-patches.\\nFor each of those remaining 1-patches, the classification of the\\ncentral tile by the\\nrules in sec:clusters is shown.\\n\\n §.§ Classification of outer tiles\\n\\nFor each of the possible neighbours that actually occurs in some of\\nthe remaining 1-patches, we can now list the possible\\nclassifications of a central tile that has such a neighbour; see\\nTable\\xa0<ref>.\\n\\nFor each of the outer tiles in', ' a 1-patch, we have some but not all\\nof its neighbours, and can take the intersection of the sets from\\nTable\\xa0<ref> to produce a set of possible classes for\\nthat outer tile.  Although this is not a single class, it can still be\\nused for the within-cluster and between-cluster checks.  In each case,\\nit turns out that the set of possible classes for a neighbour\\nappearing in one of those checks is a subset of the classes permitted\\nby that check, and so we have a complete proof of the within-cluster\\nand between-cluster matching properties that depends only on the\\nenumeration of 1-patches presented here and not on a larger\\nenumeration of 2-patches; the lists of checks

Because the metatiles admit tilings of\\n  the plane, so too does the hat.  We then prove that generic members\\n  of our continuum of polygons are aperiodic, through a new kind of\\n  geometric incommensurability argument.  Separately, we give a combinatorial,\\n  computer-assisted proof that the hat must form hierarchical—and hence\\n  aperiodic—tilings.  \\n\\n§ ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\n\\nThanks to Ava Pun for her work on software for computing Heesch numbers\\nand displaying patches.

            "The paper is about the search for an \"einstein\", a single shape that tiles aperiodically, and the proposed candidate tiles that challenge the concepts of \"tile\", \"tiling\", or \"aperiodic\". One of the proposed candidate tiles is a polykite called \"the hat\", which is proven to be an aperiodic monotile in the paper.\n",

            "The researchers found a family of aperiodic monotiles, which includes the hat polykite and another small polykite formed of 10 kites.\n",
            "Enter your question about the paper (or 'quit' to stop): how many kites is the hat polykite formed of?\n",
            "\"The hat polykite is formed of 8 kites from the [3.4.6.4] Laves tiling.\"\n",

            "Yes, the paper includes discussions of graphs and their properties in various contexts, such as cluster graphs, i-strips in a tiling, and graphs induced by a set of tiles.\n",
            "Enter your question about the paper (or 'quit' to stop): What are cluster graphs?\n",
            "The paper discusses cluster graphs, which are induced graphs with vertices corresponding to tiles in a set. Two tiles are connected by an edge in the graph if there is a maximal segment that they share and intersect in a line segment of positive length that is a subset of the segment. The paper also mentions weakly and strongly aligned sets, where weakly aligned sets have a connected graph and strongly aligned sets have a graph where all tiles sharing a maximal segment are aligned. The paper drops the qualifiers \"weakly\" and \"strongly\" when referring to aligned sets.\n",

            "\"I-strips\" are defined as two-way infinite paths in a tiling called 𝒯_4', which is a related set of i-strips partitioning the tiles of 𝒯_4 by assigning each polyiamond to the same strip as one of its rhombi. The i-strips cannot cross, and any line parallel to those in ℒ_i passes through the i-strips in 𝒯_4' in the same order as any other such line passes through them. The visualization of the three families of i-strips can be seen in fig:istrips.\n",
